# GradientEchoes


_Where Mathematics Meets Implementation_

**GradientEchoes** is a curated collection of optimization algorithms and methods — from classical mathematical formulations to modern quantum-inspired optimization — all implemented in Python. This repository aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by turning blackboard equations into executable, experimentable code.

## 🧭 Purpose

This project is both a learning journey and a technical logbook. It explores optimization techniques taught in academic courses, as well as those independently studied from advanced topics like **Quantum Physics** and **Numerical Methods**.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or curious mind, this repo serves as a guide and reference for real-world implementation of optimization algorithms using Python.

## 🧪 Philosophy

Optimization isn't just math — it's motion.  
In **GradientEchoes**, every method is treated like a story: from its theoretical roots to how it behaves in code. Equations are not just written, they’re **felt** through each iteration.
